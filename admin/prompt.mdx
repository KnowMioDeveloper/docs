description: Configure the system prompt used for AI interactions

Define the system prompt that guides AI behavior across your organization. This prompt is prepended to all AI interactions to establish behavior, tone, and constraints.

## Configuring Your System Prompt

The system prompt configuration page allows you to set organization-wide instructions that will be included in every AI interaction.

### Best Practices

When creating your system prompt:
- Use clear, specific instructions
- Define the desired tone and communication style
- Establish any behavioral constraints or guidelines
- Specify domain-specific context or requirements

### Initial Setup

If no prompt is configured yet, you'll see a message indicating "No prompt configured yet." Use the configuration interface to add your first system prompt.

### How It Works

Once configured, your system prompt will be automatically prepended to all AI interactions, ensuring consistent behavior and responses aligned with your organization's needs.
