Configure file upload settings for your organization by specifying which file types are allowed.

## File Upload Configuration

Control which file types users can upload by configuring allowed MIME types.

### Adding Allowed MIME Types

To allow file uploads:

1. Enter a valid MIME type in the input field (e.g., `text/plain`, `application/pdf`)
2. Add the MIME type to your allowed list

### Common MIME Types

Here are some commonly used MIME types:

- **Text files** - `text/plain`, `text/csv`
- **Documents** - `application/pdf`, `application/msword`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`
- **Images** - `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/svg+xml`
- **Spreadsheets** - `application/vnd.ms-excel`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`
- **JSON** - `application/json`

### Initial Setup

If no MIME types are configured, you'll see the message "No MIME types configured. Add types above to allow file uploads." Users will not be able to upload files until at least one MIME type is added to the allowed list.

## Managing Uploads

Once MIME types are configured, only files matching the allowed types can be uploaded to your organization.
