## Welcome

The KM API provides programmatic access to knowledge management features with AI-powered capabilities. This API enables you to manage documents, sessions, and leverage AI models for intelligent content processing.


## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys. Include your API key in the request headers:

```http
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY

You can generate and manage your API keys in the [API Keys](/essentials/api_keys) section of your account settings.
