## Overview

The Knowledge Base allows you to store and organize information that can be accessed by your organization members. Knowledge items can be personal (visible only to you) or shared with specific teams.

## Access Control

Knowledge visibility is determined by:

- **Personal knowledge** - Items you create without assigning to a team (visible only to you)
- **Team knowledge** - Items assigned to a team (visible to all team members)

You can only view, edit, and delete knowledge items that:
- You created (personal knowledge)
- Belong to teams you're a member of (team knowledge)
