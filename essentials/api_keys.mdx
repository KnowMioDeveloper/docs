The API Keys page allows you to create and manage API keys for programmatic access to your account.

## Managing API Keys

The API keys table displays the following information for each key:

- **Name**: The identifier you assigned to the API key
- **Status**: Whether the key is active or inactive
- **Rate Limit**: The maximum number of requests allowed per time period
- **Usage**: Current usage statistics for the key
- **Last Used**: Timestamp of the most recent API call made with this key
- **Expires**: The expiration date for the key
- **Created**: When the API key was originally created

When you first access this page, you'll see "No results" until you create your first API key.
