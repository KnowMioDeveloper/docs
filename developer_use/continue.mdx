# Setting Up Knowmio Agent for Continue.dev

This guide walks you through setting up Knowmio as a custom model in Continue.dev.

## Prerequisites

- Continue.dev extension installed (VS Code or Cursor)
- Knowmio API key (obtain from your Knowmio account)

## Step 1: Create the Agent Configuration

1. Navigate to your Continue configuration directory:
   - macOS/Linux: `~/.continue/`
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\`

2. Create or edit `config.yaml`

3. Add the following configuration:

```yaml
name: KnowMio
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

models:
  - name: Knowmio
    provider: openai
    model: knowmio-chat
    apiBase: https://api.dev.knowmio.com/api/openai
    requestOptions:
      headers:
        x-api-key: ${{ secrets.KNOWMIO_API_KEY }}
    roles:
      - chat
      - edit
    capabilities:
      - tool_use
```

## Step 2: Add Your API Key to Continue Hub Secrets

1. Open Continue Hub and go to the settings page
2. Navigate to Secrets
3. Add a new secret:
   - **Name**: `KNOWMIO_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your Knowmio API key

Alternatively, you can temporarily hardcode the API key for testing:

```yaml
requestOptions:
  headers:
    x-api-key: your-actual-api-key-here
```

## Step 3: Restart Continue

Restart the Continue extension or reload your IDE to apply the configuration.

## Step 4: Test the Integration

1. Open Continue chat
2. Select "Knowmio" from the model dropdown
3. Send a test message: "Hi, how are you?"

## Authentication Details

Knowmio uses Better Auth's API key plugin with the `x-api-key` header for authentication. The configuration uses `requestOptions.headers` to send the API key in the correct format that Knowmio's backend expects.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized Error
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure the secret name matches exactly: `KNOWMIO_API_KEY`
- Check that the API key has the correct permissions

### Configuration Parse Errors
- Verify YAML indentation (use 2 spaces, not tabs)
- Ensure no extra fields at the top level (name, version, schema should only be present for agent definitions)

### Model Not Appearing
- Restart Continue/IDE
- Check the Continue logs for errors
- Verify the `apiBase` URL is correct

## API Endpoint

The Knowmio OpenAI-compatible endpoint is located at:
- **Development**: `https://api.dev.knowmio.com/api/openai`
- **Production**: Update the `apiBase` URL accordingly

The endpoint implements the OpenAI Chat Completions API format and internally uses Claude Opus 4.1 via AWS Bedrock.
