# Using the Python OpenAI SDK with Knowmio

You can use the official OpenAI Python SDK to interact with Knowmio's AI models through our OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Knowmio API key (obtain from your Knowmio account)

## Installation

Install the OpenAI Python SDK:

```bash
pip install openai
```

## Basic Usage

Configure the SDK to point to Knowmio's API endpoint:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.dev.knowmio.com/api/openai",
    default_headers={
        "x-api-key": "your-api-key-here"
    }
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-opus-4.1",  # Model selection is handled by your Knowmio configuration
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Hello, how are you?",
        },
    ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Streaming Responses

For real-time streaming responses:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.dev.knowmio.com/api/openai",
    default_headers={
        "x-api-key": "your-api-key-here"
    }
)

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-opus-4.1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say 'double bubble bath' three times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

## Authentication

Knowmio uses API key authentication via the `x-api-key` header. Pass your API key in the `default_headers` parameter when initializing the client.

### Environment Variables

For better security, store your API key in an environment variable:

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.dev.knowmio.com/api/openai",
    default_headers={
        "x-api-key": os.environ.get("KNOWMIO_API_KEY")
    }
)
```

## Available Models

Specify the model in the `model` parameter:

- `claude-opus-4.1` - Most capable model for complex tasks
- Other models as configured in your Knowmio organization

## API Endpoint

The Knowmio OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
- **Development**: `https://api.dev.knowmio.com/api/openai`
- **Production**: Update the `base_url` accordingly

The endpoint implements the OpenAI Chat Completions API format.

## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized Error
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure you're using the `x-api-key` header (not `Authorization`)
- Check that the API key has the correct permissions

### Connection Errors
- Verify the `base_url` is correct
- Check your network connection
- Ensure you're not behind a proxy that blocks the connection

### Model Not Found
- Verify the model name is correct
- Check that the model is available in your Knowmio organization
- Ensure your API key has access to the specified model
