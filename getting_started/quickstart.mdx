## Getting Started

After your organization administrator invites you to join an organization, you can start exploring the platform's features immediately.

### Step 1: Try Plain Chat

Start by experimenting with AI chat:

1. Navigate to **Chat** in the sidebar
2. Click to start a new chat
3. Ask questions or get assistance from the AI
4. Try switching between different LLM models to see which one works best for your needs

<Tip>Different AI models have different strengths. Experiment to find the one that fits your use case.</Tip>

### Step 2: Create a Knowledge Item

Once you're comfortable with plain chat, create your first knowledge base:

1. Navigate to **Knowledge** in the sidebar
2. Create a new knowledge item
3. Upload one or multiple files to the knowledge item
   - Supported formats include PDFs, Word documents, images, videos, and audio files
4. Wait for the file status to change from "pending" to "processed"

<Note>File processing time varies depending on the size and type of files you upload.</Note>

### Step 3: Chat with Your Knowledge

After your files are processed, you can chat with your knowledge base:

1. Open a chat (or start a new one from the **Chat** section)
2. Click the book icon under the chat input box
3. Select the knowledge item you want to add to the conversation
4. Start asking questions about your uploaded content

The AI will now provide context-aware responses based on your specific documents and data.
